- Real-time tracking of index finger and thumb taps using a webcam.
- Calculates tap count, mean inter-tap interval, and variability.
- Fully browser-based, no installation required.
- Lightweight and easy to integrate into studies or experiments.

## Usage

1. Open \`index.html\` in a modern web browser with camera access.
2. Allow webcam access when prompted.
3. Tap your index finger and thumb together in front of the camera.
4. Real-time metrics will be displayed on the screen.
